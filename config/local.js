/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * This config file should include any settings specific to a particular
 * environment (development / production).
 *
 * Note the configuration files located in /config/environments/.  That is where
 * environment-specific settings should be placed.  This 'local' configuration
 * module simply loads the settings from a file in that directory if one is
 * found that matches process.env.NODE_ENV.
 *
 * Also note that, if needed, you can create a file in /config/environments/
 * called 'myLocal.js'.  This file is included in .gitignore and will not be
 * committed, and should only be used if your particular local development
 * environment needs further customizations from what is found in the existing
 * 'development.js' configuration module.
 *
 * For more information, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation
